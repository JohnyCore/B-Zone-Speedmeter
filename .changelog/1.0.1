Optimized Textdraw ID Search Range:

Before: The script previously searched for textdraw IDs within the full range from 0 to 4000. This led to unnecessary processing and longer execution times, especially if the target textdraw was within a smaller subset of IDs.
Now: The search range has been narrowed to 2000 to 2150, which is more specific to the use case, resulting in faster search times and reduced processing overhead.
 

Why is this an optimization?

Searching a smaller range of textdraw IDs reduces the amount of unnecessary checks in the loop, leading to better performance.
In environments where textdraws are limited to specific ID ranges, narrowing the range makes the search more efficient, and make sure that the script only focuses on relevant IDs.
